                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>The Friend Factory project is the manifestation of a concept that has inspired me for some time. The project attempts to recontextualize animals not typically understood as pets by assigning them quirky names. This is done through some application of Javascript code, randomizing names and images so that each user gets a unique 'friend.' The code was optimized with Jquery, using class selectors to toggle the visibility of certain elements.</p></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><img src="image/project-4/ff-sket.jpg"></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>The project began with some wireframe sketches, which were primarily used to determine the overall layout and composition. These sketches also were used to help solve the question of the implementation of a QR code as well as an on-site refresh button. A priority with this project was the creation of a barebone mobile user experience, so the graphic design was left to a minimalist single column.</p></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><img src="image/project-4/buttons-01.jpg"></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>One priority with the Friend Factory project was to create an aesthetically pleasing experience. With so few elements the weight of this burden rested predominately on the title and the button. As such, these two elements must function well both on their own and together. A sans serif font was chosen for the typeface, as a serif font would provide unwanted context to the project. The button was arguably the hardest element to style, though ultimately a borderless, rounded button with a slight neutral gradient was used. </p></div></div>

                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>An important design choice for the project was the implementation of a refresh button as well as a QR code for easy sharing. Ultimately both of these elements were included; however, their inclusion was a point of contention in the design process. </p></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>A key aspect of my web design process is responsive functionality. For this minimalistic project, the responsiveness came in the form of automatic resizing text sizes. Using the Perfect Fourth modular text scale helped ensure that the ratio of text elements would stay consistent between different screen sizes.</p></div></div>

                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>Animal with Type was an exercise in combining organic animal forms with typographic exploration. The fundamental composition of the project adhered to a golden ratio grid, with design elements either aligning to that or each other. The purpose of this project was to gain a greater understanding of how graphical systems can increase the overall aesthetic value of a composition. In this particular case, I aligned the composition to both the golden ratio and a 238Â° angle. In the preliminary stages of this project, I constructed a small set of square and rectangular compositions. The primary purpose of each of these studies was a demonstration of the inherent forces within the composition.</p></div></div>

                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>The above studies are a sampling of the work that was done leading up to this project. Each composition sought to display the inherent forces that lie within the rectangular or square composition, respectively. The line and shape of the study were carefully placed to better activate the space, creating the effect of motion, shifting the eye from one place towards a focal point.</p></div></div>

                <div class="col-6"><div class="port-text"><p>The project began with the construction of an animal form. I created the shrimp form out of intersecting circular and elliptical elements. The shrimp was chosen because of the inherent significance of its spiraled form, which aligns rather cleverly to the golden ratio. To accompany the animal subject a sans-serif typeface was required; in this case, Source Sans Variable was used. I chose this particular typeface because I believed it to compliment the simplistic beauty of the previously constructed animal form.</p></div></div>

                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>The final composition was created to align not only with the golden ratio but also along the diagonal axis of the rectangle. The usage of perpendicular elements draws emphasis from the type towards the animal form. Ultimately this compositional system created a study that was not only valuable for its aesthetic qualities but also for its systematic qualitites.</p></div></div>

                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>The Onitsuka Pop-Up Shop project was an exercise in creating branding elements for a fictional pop-up shop for Japanese brand Onitsuka Tiger. The brand was renamed to Asics in the 1970s, though it was relaunched in 2002. I was first inspired to start this project upon learning that the origin of the Asics name was rooted in the brand's Latin mantra-"anima sana in corpore sano"-a latin phrase that translates to "a sound mind in a sound body." Within this project, I sought to create a composition that encapsulated this phrase through typography, and composition. This process began with a long iterative design process that ultimately resulted in the final compositions which would be used to spread awareness for the event. </p></div></div>

                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>I started this project with the creation of both physical thumbnail and quick digital sketches. The one key required element was the inclusion of the brand tagline. Another required element was the use of a design element that encapsulated the brandâ€™s deep history. Several design elements were considered in the iterative process, each one capitalizing on some aspect of the brand.</p></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><img src=image/project-3/palette.jpg></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>I chose two color palettes for the project: "Mexico 68" and "Kill Bill." Each palette was designed after a significant touchstone in Onitsuka Tiger's brand history. The "Mexico 68" palette follows the colors of the Mexican flag, harkening back to the brand's involvement in the Mexico 1968 Olympics, at which the new, well-recognized Asics logo was first revealed. The "Kill Bill" color palette alludes to Onitsuka Tiger's connection with film, taking cues from the yellow and black Onitsuka Footwear worn by both Uma Thurman in Kill Bill and Bruce Lee in Game of Death. Each palette touches on a different, but uniquely important, aspect of the Onitsuka brand's complex and rich history.</p></div></div>

                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>The typeface selections were made to represent the calmness of mind that is associated with the heading. The minimalist aesthetic of the type prescribes less context to the message and leaves the reader pondering the message of the words in front of them. I chose the design element to resemble a running track: a sport that the Onitsuka brand has a deep connection with. </p></div></div>

                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>I translated the design element into each of the color palettes, creating a sticker set that could be used for promotional materials or as a handout. The benefit of the design is that it is a recognizable geometric shape that reads well when placed on a wall or laptop.</p></div></div>

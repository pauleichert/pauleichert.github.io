                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>This typographic composition project was an exercise in creating meaningful typographic compositions. The goal of the project was to create an effective advertising material for a fictional museum exhibition for renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright. One of the major challenges of the project was creating a design system that incorporated various specific aspects of Wright's design methodology and system.</p></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><img src="image/project-2/biography.jpg"></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>The project began with the creation of a small biographical page. Images of notable Frank Lloyd Wright architecture were used to draw inspiration from. In addition, body copy was written for use over the course of the project. The body copy would form the majority of the text that would be typeset. The remainder of the composition would be comprised of Wright's name, a quote describing his work, a name for the exhibition, and some information specific to the museum exhibition, like time, date, location.</p></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>The design process for this project had a heavy emphasis on iteration. Close to one hundred digital sketches were created, each with varying levels of typographic adjustment. For instance, some studies were mandated to stay within one font-family, one type size, one line height, et cetera. Other studies had no such restrictions.</p></div></div>

                </div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>This is a small sample of the digital process work that was created. One major goal in the design process was to convey Wright's idea of Usonia &#40;an idealist harmony between the modern life and nature, architectural geometry and the natural world&#41; through typography. This was done by showing the contrast between different typographic attributes&#8212;particularly that contrast between justified and unjustified/staggered type. This contrast was also achieved by different type alignment, angular typesetting, and asymmetrical composition.</p></div></div>

                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>The final composition was chosen because of its clear typographic hierarchy, representation of design elements, and overall adherence to a system. </p></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><img src="image/project-2/deslang.jpg"></div></div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>Ultimately, this composition resulted in the creation of a design language with an H1, H2, Body, and design element. Each of these elements would be carried further in order to create a small, square booklet with pages describing Frank Lloyd Wright's most famous works. This modular system could be outfitted to work with any type of content.</p></div></div>

                </div>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-6"><p>The ultimate result of the project was a series of typographic and photographic compositions, each utilizing the hierarchy and design elements established with the final square composition. These compositions would make up the pages of a Frank Lloyd Wright informational brochure, which would presumably be given out at the The Site and People exhibition.</p></div></div>
